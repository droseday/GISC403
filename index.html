	<!-- EDIT THE DESCRIPTION HERE -->
	This map highlights the four international airports of New Zealand in 2024 (and includes the formerly international Dunedin airport). 
	As the only focus was to identify their locations, not assist in nagivation or advertise nearby attractions, the basemap was simplified through the removal of labels from points of interest and standardisation of road symbology.
	The base land cover class colour was also darkened slightly to improve the contrast between features (especially with the purple territorial authority polygon overlay). Yellow was chosen for the border and fill of the Dunedin airport polygon as it contrasts well with this purple, making it more easily identifiable.
